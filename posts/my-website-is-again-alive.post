My website after a host change, dropping of personal blog, complete overhaul of UI etc has went live. :P

Blueprint CSS saved my day. I hate tinkering with css stuff. No mood to try any CMS too. So sat back found that blueprint, and finally brought a somewhat-nice-site up. I am happy. Real happy :)
