Just found out how to get time-stamps printed along with the date in the post headings of plaintxt theme :) Tweaking into wordpress is great fun. Soon or later, i will start contributing to wordpress.

Just i had to figure out the function which returns the post-time and call it in the code which builds the header for each post :)
