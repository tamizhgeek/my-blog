It's my long wish to contribute code to <a href="http://tcenet.tce.edu" target="_blank">TCENet </a>, an F/OSS based ERP portal of my college.

I dint have a proper guidance, so i lacked in my progress. And there comes <a href="http://sbalamurugan.wordpress.com">bala</a> anna, he gave lot of suggestions, made me involved in this,encouraged, cleared my doubts without a single fuss! So, things started getting shape, and one fine evening after his approval, i sent the patch to project-mentors. After a round of review and corrections my patch was accepted. I'm damn happy :D All thanks to bala anna.

Later within a week my another patch was also accepted. Of-course both are trivial, stupid patches, But still it encourages me :P
