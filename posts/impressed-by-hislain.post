Here it is- <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain">http://github.com/yuvipanda/HiSlain</a>

HiSlain- A small static blog publishing app written in python. Well am pretty impressed with it after seeing it in action here - <a href="http://yuvi.in/blog">http://yuvi.in/blog</a>

It is developed by yuvipanda- a die hard coder( <a href="http://github.com/yuvipanda">http://github.com/yuvipanda</a>) :)

It has blocks, plugins (Suprise suprise!) etc.

An almostÂ  GPL-ed software available for sharing and reuse.

So decided to get my hands over it, help in develop it, port this plaintxtblog theme to HiSlain and to use it as my blog-tool. A to-do marked for coming study-holidays :P

I am happy to hack with it :)
