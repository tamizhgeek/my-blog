After seeing my friend's [site](http://meetgautham.co.cc) here, I was very impressed and wish my
site would also have such neat, cool and clean design. Actually I hate designing and css stuff.
But yet I decided to get my hands over it and try as far as I could. So my website design is in the process of updation. 

A tiny part - designing a new header is finished. Have a look :)
