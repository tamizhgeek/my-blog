Now am seriously into this. I was reading through the code of this pretty app from 6.30 morning today. Its sooper cool and i am simply amazed. Finished off the functionality code part. I have to learn that jinja2 templating language used in that. The first taskÂ  I''d would like to do - is porting this 'plaintxtblog' theme to HiSlain. I'm sure i am going to start it *right now* . I slightly remember, i have analysis of algorithms exams tomorrow. But who cares?

As i said _i_am_seriously_into_this :P
