Well, I have completed the topics i was instructed to learn by my <a href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/">mentor</a>. They include,<br /><br />1) Read the communication/project guidelines to be followed while doing  F/OSS project.<br /> <br />   Read and understood with the help of wonderful materials here<br /><ol><li><a href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/communication-guidelines.pdf">Read mailing list guidelines<br /></a></li><li><a href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/communication-guidelines.pdf">Read Communication Guidelines</a></li><li><a href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf">Read i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do</a></li><li><a href="http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/gnu-coding-guidelines.odp">Read GNU Coding Guidelines</a></li></ol>2) Basic commands in Linux(ownership,permissions,grep).<br /> <br />   This i am familiar with already, as i am using Linux for more than a year now.<br /><br />3) Emacs<br /><br />I have used this pretty cool editor at times before and didn't take much time.<br /> <br />  Cheat sheet for emacs -<a href="http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/hyd/emacs-a-day-keeps-the-vi-zing-away.txt">Emacs-a-day-keeps-the-vi-zing-away</a><br />4) Version Control system(GIT)<br /><br />I am already used to SVN, and now have learnt about git and its usage.<br />Hmmm., anyway i think SVN was more easy for me as of now. Things might change after i get my hands dirty with Git.<br /><br />I was instructed previously to learn bash scripting also, but that was put on hold for some time now. Other than that, am done with the remaining. :-)
