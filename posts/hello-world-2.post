<div class="main">  <div class="snap_preview"><p>A traditional first post. <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p> <p>I was instructed by my mentor to create a blog to update my activities in the project.</p> <p>I do already have a personal blog. I don’t want to mess it up with this because, if more people will be visiting to this blog then all my personal junk will be thrown all over the search engines. Grrr.</p> <p>So, decided to start a new one for sharing my technical experiences. I will also be updating my status and work done regarding my project in this space.<br /></p> <p>OK. Now, whats the project am going to do?? Well, that’s yet to be decided.</p> <p>These are some preliminary preparations i have to do <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p> <p>Meet you soon with an update:-D</p> </div></div>
